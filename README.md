Hello! This repo consists of the files needed for a website that I am creating for Clarkson University's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE).
As Publicity Chair of this organization, I have tasked myself with developing (from scratch) and maintaining a website that provides users with easily-accessible information about SWE. 

More updates to follow!
